Question 1:
Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the
number, and the program provides hints (higher or lower) until the correct number is guessed. Using random
number generation, loops (while), conditional statements, input/output

Question 2:
Write a Python program that asks for a string as input and prints a version with each word capitalized and a full
stop added at the end (if not already present). Constraints: Use character-by-character processing and string
concatenation, avoiding slicing and string methods like upper(), title() and endswith().

Question 3:
Write a Python program that asks for a string as input and determine whether it's a palindrome (reads the
same backward as forward) or not.
Constraints: Use only individual character comparisons and string reversal techniques, avoiding slicing and
built-in functions like reversed().

Question 4:
A local bakery employs three bakers with varying hourly rates and overtime rules:
● Baker 1:
○ $15.00 per hour for regular hours
○ Time-and-a-half for hours over 35
● Baker 2:
○ $16.25 per hour for regular hours
○ Double-time for hours over 40
● Baker 3:
○ $17.75 per hour for regular hours
○ Time-and-a-half for hours from 41 up to 45
○ Double-time for hours over 45
Write a Python program that does the following:
1. Asks for the number of hours worked by each baker last week.
2. Stores this information in separate variables.
3. Determines each baker's gross pay based on their respective pay rates and overtime rules. Consider
the different thresholds for overtime pay.
4. Applies a 30% tax rate to each baker's gross pay.
5. Subtracts the calculated taxes from each baker's gross pay to determine their net pay.
6. Displays each baker's hours worked, gross pay, taxes, and net pay in a clear and organized format,
using appropriate labels.

Question 5:
A hotel offers various room types with different pricing structures:
● Standard Room:
○ $155 per night for single occupancy
○ $160 per night for double occupancy
○ $165 per night for triple or more occupancy
● Deluxe Room:
○ $195 per night for single or double occupancy
○ $210 per night for triple occupancy
○ $225 per night for quadruple or more occupancy
● Additional charges:
○ 12% tax on room charges
○ $15 per person per day for breakfast (optional)
○ $25 per day for parking (optional)
● Discounts:
○ 10% off for stays longer than 5 nights

Write a Python program that:
1. Prompts for user input:
a. Room type (Standard or Deluxe)
b. Number of nights
c. Number of people
d. Meal charges (if any)
2. Calculates room charges: Uses appropriate conditional statements to determine the correct rates based
on room type and occupancy.
3. Calculates additional charges: Includes taxes, breakfast charges (if applicable), and other service
charges.
4. Generates a detailed bill: Clearly lists each charge with a descriptive label (e.g., room rate, tax,
breakfast, parking).
5. Provides a subtotal of charges before tax.
6. Displays the total amount due, including all taxes and fees.
